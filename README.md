**NOTE:** You need to have python(newer than 3.9) and libraries installed.
[HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**INSTALL DISCORD LIBARY**
```
pip install discord.py
```

After  downloading zip(code) and installed packages, you need to run it.

After  that enable discord developer options on your account.Then go [HERE](https://discord.com/developers/applications), that's Discord Developer Portal. Click on the applications, then at top right u have new application, put name from there it's simple just follow instructions on your screen.

**I suggest using the IDE of your choice** [LIST OF IDES FOR PYTHON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python).

When you are done, take the API from Developer Portal, make a json file in the same directory where main.py and the rest of the code is, paste your API and name file BOT_API. Click save(ctrl+s). 

Just click main.py and then run.

If you wanna change bot answers go to odgovori.py and put whatever you want.
Have fun!
