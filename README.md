**NOTE:** You need to have python(newer than 3.9) and libraries installed.
[HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**INSTALL DISCORD LIBARY**
```
pip install discord.py
```

After u downloaded zip with code and installed packages. U need to run it.

U will need to enable discord developer options on your account.Then go [HERE](https://discord.com/developers/applications), thats Discord Developer Portal. Click on the applications then at top right u have new application put name from there its simple just follow instructions on your screen.

**I suggest to use IDE of your choice** [LIST OF IDES FOR PYTHON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python)
When u are done take API from Developer Portal make json file in same directory where main.py and rest of the code is, paste your API and name file BOT_API. Click save(ctrl+s). 
Just click main.py and then run.
